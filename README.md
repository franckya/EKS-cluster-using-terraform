# EKS-cluster-using-terraform
Deploy nodes on an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster using Terraform

Install Terraform:
First, make sure that you have Terraform installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the Terraform website or install it using a package manager like Homebrew on macOS or Linux.

Configure your AWS credentials:
Before you can use Terraform to create resources in your AWS account, you need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating an AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key in the AWS Management Console and then setting the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables.

Create a Terraform configuration file:
Next, create a Terraform configuration file (e.g., main.tf) that defines the resources you want to create.
